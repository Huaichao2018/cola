#
# == details
# The object contains results from all combinations of top-value methods
# and partitioning methods.
#
# == Methods
# The `ConsensusPartitionList-class` provides following methods:
#
# -`run_all_consensus_partition_methods`: constructor method.
# -`top_rows_overlap,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: plot the overlaps of top rows under different top-value methods.
# -`top_rows_heatmap,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: plot the heatmap of top rows under different top-value methods.
# -`get_classes,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: get consensus subgroup labels merged from all methods.
# -`get_matrix,ConsensusPartition-method`: get the original matrix.
# -`get_stats,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: get statistics for the partition for a specified k.
# -`get_membership,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: get consensus membership matrix summarized from all methods.
# -`suggest_best_k,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: guess the best number of subgroups for all methods.
# -`collect_plots,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: collect plots from all combinations of top-value methods and partitioning methods with choosing a plotting function.
# -`collect_classes,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: make a plot which contains predicted subgroups from all combinations of top-value methods and partitioning methods.
# -`test_to_known_factors,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: test correlation between predicted subgroups and known annotations, if provided.
# -`cola_report,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: generate a HTML report for the whole analysis.
# -`functional_enrichment,ConsensusPartitionList-method`: perform functional enrichment analysis on significant genes if rows in the matrix can be corresponded to genes.
