\title{
Concordance to the consensus partition
}
\description{
Concordance to the consensus partition
}
\usage{
concordance(membership_each, class)
}
\arguments{

  \item{membership_each}{A matrix which contains partitions in every single runs where columns correspond to runs. The object can be get from \code{get_membership(..., each = TRUE)}.}
  \item{class}{Consensus subgroup labels.}

}
\details{
Note subgroup labels in \code{membership_each} should already be adjusted to the consensus labels, e.g. by \code{\link{relabel_class}}.

The concordance score is the mean proportion of samples having the same subgroup labels as the consensus labels
among individual partition runs.
}
\value{
A numeric value.
