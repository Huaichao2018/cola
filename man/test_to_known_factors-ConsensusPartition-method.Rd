Test correspondance between predicted subgroups and known factors

\usage{
\S4method{test_to_known_factors}{ConsensusPartition}(object, k, known = get_anno(object),
    silhouette_cutoff = 0.5, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{

  \item{object}{A \code{\link{ConsensusPartition-class}} object.}
  \item{k}{Number of subgroups. It uses all \code{k} if it is not specified.}
  \item{known}{A vector or a data frame with known factors. By default it is the annotation table set in \code{\link{consensus_partition}} or \code{\link{run_all_consensus_partition_methods}}.}
  \item{silhouette_cutoff}{Cutoff for sihouette scores. Samples with value less than it are omit.}
  \item{verbose}{Whether to print messages.}

}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:

\itemize{
  \item number of samples used to test after filtered by \code{silhouette_cutoff},
  \item p-values from the tests,
  \item number of subgroups.
}
