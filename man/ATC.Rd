\usage{
ATC(mat, cor_fun = stat::cor, min_cor = 0, power = 1,
    mc.cores = 1, n_sampling = 1000, q_sd = 0, group = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{

  \item{mat}{A numeric matrix. ATC score is calculated by rows.}
  \item{cor_fun}{A function which calculates correlations.}
  \item{min_cor}{Cutoff for the minimal absolute correlation.}
  \item{power}{Power on the correlation values.}
  \item{mc.cores}{Number of cores.}
  \item{n_sampling}{When there are too many rows in the matrix, to get the curmulative distribution of how one row correlates other rows, actually we don't need to use all the rows in the matrix, e.g. 1000 rows can already give a very nice estimation.}
  \item{q_sd}{Percentile of the standard deviation for the rows. Rows with values less than it are ignored.}
  \item{group}{A categorical variable. If it is specified, the correlation is only calculated for the rows in the same group as current row.}
  \item{...}{Pass to \code{cor_fun}.}

}
\details{
For a given row in a matrix, the ATC score is the area above the curve of the curmulative density
distribution of the absolute correlation to all other rows. Formally, if \code{F_i(X)} is the 
cumulative distribution function of \code{X} where \code{X} is the absolute correlation for row i with power \code{power} (i.e. \code{x = cor^power}),
\code{ATC_i = 1 - \\int_{min_cor}^1 F_i(X)}.

By default the ATC scores are calculated by Pearson correlation, to use Spearman correlation, you can register
the top-value method by:

  \preformatted{
    register_top_value_methods(
        "ATC_spearman" = function(m) ATC(m, method = "spearman")
    )  }

Similarly, to use a robust correlation method, e.g. \code{\link[WGCNA]{bicor}} function, you can do like:

  \preformatted{
    register_top_value_methods(
        "ATC_bicor" = function(m) ATC(m, cor_fun = WGCNA::bicor)
    )  }
}
